# Sigmoid Neural Network

SigmoidNN is a simple **2-Layer Neural Network** created by using the sigmoid function as the activation function.

**Activation Function**:  It's a function that determines the output of a neuron based on its input, deciding whether it should be activated or not.

**Sigmoid Function**: The Sigmoid Function is denoted as the following

The sigmoid function makes an **S-Curve** graph with the values lying between **0** and **1** . This Graph can be represented as the following:

In this simple project, the neural network takes the defined numpy array as the input dataset and uses the sigmoid function to predict the output values.

To reduce the errors, we use backpropagation.
